# TouchDesigner Data Science

## About
This project is used to organize my thoughts on manefestations of data science using TouchDesigner. 
From my graduate work in space physics through the six years I spent at NASA, I've always been fascinated with the aesthetics of data visualization. As the field of data science has emerged, the need to communicate these ideas has never been greater.  By providing a platform for real-time analysis and exploration, TouchDesigner offers a unique approach to this challenge. Moreover, the ability to rapidly prototype ideas using visual programing is a huge benefit: TouchDesigner's graph-based metaphors are very similar to the now-defunct OpenDX, which I used for the majority of PhD research in space physics. Moreover, TouchDesigner uses python under the hood, which has become the weapon of choice for most data scientists.

Above shows a realtime visualization of the acceleration I feel when I'm skateboarding. The color of the edges comes from the components of acceleration, which I get from the phone in my back pocket. The time-delay between the edge trails is constant, so they get farther apart the faster I'm going. All of this was achieved in a matter of hours in TouchDesigner.
